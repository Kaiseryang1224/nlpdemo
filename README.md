# NLP Demo

This is a Demo project working on Natural Processing Language testing some fundamentals use cases of NLP such as:
  * Sentiment Analysis: Try to predict if a text (i.e. review, comment) is positive or negative
  * Question Answer: Given a large text, try to extract answers by asking questions on top of the text.
  * Summarization: Summarize a text without losing the context.
  * Word Analogy: Find the nearest neighbor word based in a corpus input
  * Text Mining: This consists of extracting information from a text, such as verbs, person's name, entities, countries, places, etc.
  * And some more
  
### Most important dependecies:
1. [Spacy IO](https://spacy.io/) - Industrial-Strength Natural Language Processing
2. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) - State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing for PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0

#### The project is divided into two parts
1. NLP API - A Flask based api.
2. NLP Web APP - Vue Js application

#### Examples

1. A question answering solution
